## Creative Coding + AI II: Custom Pixel

My AI camera is inspired by a small bit of AI prompting showcased by Byron Mattell in his lecture "AI and Sustainability in Design" for DSDN221 at Te Herenga Waka - Victoria University of Wellington. This involved taking a photo of the atrium at Te Aro Campus and prompting the AI to turn it into an overgrown, green space. I decided I wanted to apply this concept to this assignment by building a filter that resembles growing vines and greenery to be pasted over a recognisable aspect of an urban environment. Initially I thought of using pictures roads in rural places but felt this was an unoriginal and overdone idea. Instead I turned to photos of city skylines and skyscrapers. I was worried the AI would find these difficult to identify as there can be so much variation in buildings but it did surprisingly well and I only ended up running two sets of images through training before I was completely satisfied with the results. All of my images came from royalty free sources.

I rendered my initial images with Phoebe Zeller's 3 layer halo code, and some basic pointilism out of interest in how they would impact my images. I was most interested in using a texture to paste vines onto the buildings, so I built this up using the base texture code provided. I experimented with the texture quite a lot, including changing the size/amount of the leaves and the background colour (white vs black), alongside changing the RGB colour value maps to best create the effect of dense greenery.

For the background, I played around with heightening the saturation levels to make the colours, particularly the sky, really stand out and give the effect that the earth is thriving. This did not work particularly well for my third initial image as the sky was too overcast to register as blue-toned and so ended up coming out red. I attempted to solve this by adding a blue hue but this of course impacted other aspects of the image such as trees. I decided I could lean into this by instead applying a teal hue, which has tones that matched all of the common aspects of my images including the sky, water and existing greenery. The output of some of the skys also remind me of Northern Lights, and overall I think it creates a very earthy feel.

The final step was to input my AI generated masks. I choose a selection from the two sets I ran, including one nighttime image with illuminated billboards and road, and another with a complex suburbia and spaghetti roads as a base. I did this in order to best test the AI. Post-rendering, the nighttime image had the interesting effect of creating a overly bright road and a slight halo around some of the buildings, but I thought it was still a successful input. The complex city mask was well generated but slightly imperfect as it just rounded off some confusing corners.
